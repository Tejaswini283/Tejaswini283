### Hi there, I'm Tejaswini! 👋

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at **Rivian** with 6 years of experience transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. I specialize in the end-to-end development and deployment of machine learning models, from predictive analytics to reinforcement learning.

- 🔭 I’m currently focused on leveraging AI to solve challenges in the electric vehicle manufacturing and supply chain space.
- 🌱 I’m passionate about the entire ML lifecycle, from data engineering and EDA to model deployment and MLOps.
- 💡 Fun fact: When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me singing, exploring local food, or with a good book!
